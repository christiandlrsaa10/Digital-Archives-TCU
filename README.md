# Thesis Archiving Tool Featuring: Binary Search Algorithm for Keyword Based 

  Keyword-based search is critical for finding particular information within documents quickly and efficiently. It provides accuracy by letting users to accurately describe their search parameters, restricting the scope of the search and obtaining documents that fit their query. The adaptability of keyword-based search enables a wide range of search preferences, allowing users to conduct searches using diverse combinations of words, phrases, or particular keywords.

  This thesis presents the design and implementation of a Thesis Archiving Tool for Taguig City University that leverages the efficiency and effectiveness of the Binary Search Algorithm. The goal of this tool is to provide a robust and user-friendly solution for organizing and retrieving large volumes of theses and research papers stored in digital archives. By employing the Binary Search Algorithm, the tool offers rapid search capabilities, reducing the time required to locate specific documents within the archive. This paper describes the performance evaluation of the developed solution as well as the system architecture and algorithmic methodology. The findings show that using the Binary Search Algorithm resulted in a considerable boost in search efficiency
